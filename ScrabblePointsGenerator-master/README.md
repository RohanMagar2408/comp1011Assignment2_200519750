# ScrabblePointsGenerator
JavaFX application named “Scrabble points Generator”
The application will allow the user to TYPE in a word and it will calculate how many points that word is using the scrabble point system.

The application will also decrease the letter counter when the user has entered a word. For example, there are 9 “A” letters in the bag in scrabble. If the user enters the words “ha” and “able”, he or she has only 7 “A” letter remaining.

Keep a running Point total and a history of words submitted.

The restrictions for valid words are as follows:
• Two letters minimum
o One letter must be vowel
▪ A, E, I, O, U or Y
• 8 letters maximum
• Cannot have duplicate words

The Total Points area will run a running total
The grid of letters will display the point values for each letter. Also note that the point values are NOT according to Scrabble rules.
The Submit Word button will determine if word is valid.
The Previous Words section will store previous words
